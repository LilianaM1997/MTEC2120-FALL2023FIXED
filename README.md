*/Note: I created the gun for the player and attach it so no matter what direction the gun will always aim where the player is facing. Also created a bullet prefab and made scripts called Gun and bullet respectively.*/

//Homework #3//

*/Note: Created a balloon using a sphere and cylinder. Then I created a script called BalloonFloat and typed the value in code and the speed to make the balloon float. PopBallon script was made where if the bullet touches the balloon then it would destroy the balloon.*/

/*Note: for homework 5 I made a custom input where I assign the F key to activate an animation called dodgebackward on the input binding. Then, I modify both the StarterAssetsInputs and ThirdPersonController scripts to add the input in code.*/

 //Homework #6//

/*Note: for homework 6, 2 animations (Dance Robot and Dance HipHop) were used and assigned to keys 2 and 3 respectively. Using the statecontroller script and tweaked the thirdpersoncontroller script to include IDs for both animations. Both are set as triggers so that the player can transition one dance to another by pressing the keys anytime.*/

//Homework #7//

*/Note: For this assignment I setup the item and chest to be interactable.By following the instruction, the player would walk up to any of these objects and a text would pop-up and prompt the player to press the E button to interact with these objects.*/ 


//Homework #8//

*/ Note: a refine version of Homework #7 where the pop-up text and collion of the coins and teasure chest is much more consistent to where it's easier to pick up the item and open/close chest.*/  




*/Short Summary:

My project was to make an adventure style game inspired by the Lengend of Zelda. You explore, find items, interact with NPC and fight monster. In my game there are multiple things that are interactble such as Coins, Doors, teasure chest, NPC, and save point(more of a proof of concept). There are a few audio interations for some of these as well when the player interacts with them. The setting is meant to be forest place and a small part of that world there's a village with a few houses. The player would start there before going and explore through the forest and mountians to fight the dragon. The player has a health bar and a gun. The amount of coins is also tracked as well.*/
